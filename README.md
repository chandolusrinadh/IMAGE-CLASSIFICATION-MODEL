PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project involved designing and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to perform image classification using deep learning techniques. The aim was to enable a computer to automatically recognize and classify images into different categories based on their visual content. This task was accomplished using a supervised learning approach, and the project was implemented as part of the internship deliverables under CodTech.

Image classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision and has widespread applications such as in facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and more. To solve this problem, we utilized a type of deep learning architecture called a Convolutional Neural Network, which is specifically designed to work with image data.

For this project, we used the CIFAR-10 dataset, a standard benchmark dataset in the field of image classification. The dataset consists of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels) divided into 10 different classes such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Before feeding the images into the CNN model, preprocessing steps like normalization were applied to ensure better training stability and faster convergence.

The CNN architecture developed for this task involved multiple layers, including convolutional layers to extract features from the images, pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, dropout layers to reduce overfitting, and dense (fully connected) layers to perform the classification based on the features extracted. The model was trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized using the Adam optimizer, which is known for its efficiency in deep learning applications.

During training, the model was evaluated on a validation dataset to monitor its performance and detect any signs of overfitting or underfitting. The training process showed a steady increase in both training and validation accuracy across epochs, indicating that the model was learning effectively. A visual graph of the accuracy over epochs was also generated to illustrate the model’s improvement.

After training, the model’s performance was tested on the unseen test dataset. The evaluation results showed that the CNN achieved a good level of accuracy, demonstrating its capability to generalize well on new data. Although the baseline model reached moderate accuracy, this performance could be improved further by applying data augmentation techniques, tuning hyperparameters, and experimenting with deeper or more complex architectures.

The project was carried out using Google Colab, which provided a cloud-based environment with access to GPUs. This significantly reduced the training time and provided a smooth and efficient platform for development. Using Colab also simplified sharing and collaboration, as all files and outputs could be stored in Google Drive and accessed anywhere.

Through this project, valuable hands-on experience was gained in the entire deep learning pipeline, including data preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and result interpretation. It also provided practical knowledge of working with TensorFlow, one of the most widely-used deep learning frameworks in the industry.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated how Convolutional Neural Networks can be applied to solve real-world image classification problems. It not only met the technical requirements of the internship task but also offered insights into model performance monitoring and improvement strategies. This experience will serve as a strong foundation for future work in artificial intelligence and computer vision.
